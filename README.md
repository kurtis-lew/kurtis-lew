### Hi there, I'm Kurtis (they/them) ðŸ‘‹

I've been a computing hardware enthusiast for as long as I can remember. My formal education is in Electronics Engineering from Simon Fraser University (go Red Leafs), which complements my years working on embedded firmware through open-source contributions, freelance services, and industry work.

In my free time, I'm a home cook, avid gym goer, and ergonomic mechanical keyboard fiend. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in connecting and discussing business opportunities!
